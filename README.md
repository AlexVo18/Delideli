# Project SWP


## Technologies Used
+ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
+ Backend: Java Web (Ant)
+ Framework: Bootstrap
+ Others: Figma (Designing), GitLab (Managing), SQL Server (Database)

## Info
This is an online recipe management web app that helps with making, finding and creating new recipes, as well a 'Plan Management' feature to help with people who wants to use these recipes for dieting purposes

## My role in the team
I am the Front-end of the team. I create the design using Figma and implement it as well

## Limitation
At that time, we didn't know there were some issues with the version of Java Web we are using (Ant version), not until the project was halfway there, so it was either keep going or scrap it all up and restart. So the result of it was some of the webapp functions have some noticable limitation, like being very slowed and clunky to use
